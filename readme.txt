Thank you for checking out my game.
Please note that I am a third year CS student, and I am
still learning as I practice my skills.

All code, music, and textures were created by me from scratch.

If you'd like to give me feedback on how to make my code
more efficient or clear, you can reach me at: michaelkellammc@gmail.com
Any feedback at all is appreciated!
