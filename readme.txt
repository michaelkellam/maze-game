Thank you for checking out my game.
Please note that I am a third year CS student, and I am
still learning as I practice my skills.

All code, music, and textures were created by me from scratch.

If you'd like to give me feedback on how to make my code
more efficient or clear, you can reach me at: michaelkellammc@gmail.com
Any feedback at all is appreciated!

What I learned from this project:

-Documentation is important. While the code may not have been complex, it was
sometimes difficult to go back to the code after a period of time and understand
how to either tweak it or use it.

-Keeping classes organized, as well as set for one main purpose helps the maintainability
of the code.

-Algorithms and methods must be efficient, both in speed and memory usage. The game's performance
would decrease dramatically on my computer on certain levels that had a lot more entities (usually the
blocks). Thus, there are definitely other ways I could render the game and check the game's logic at 
every tick. It's just a matter of slowly improving my methods.
